# Disjoint Paths Algorithm in Symmetric Networks

This repository contains the implementation of a Disjoint Paths Algorithm that works specifically with symmetric networks. The algorithm is separated into two Jupyter Notebook files, `Networks.ipynb` and `DisjointPathsAlgorithm.ipynb`.

## Dependencies

The following packages need to be installed to use the algorithm:

```shell
pip install network
pip install import-ipynb
```
## Contents

1. Assign the network you want to test to the testNetwork variable.
2. Pass the source node and destination node to the beginDiscovery function.

If you are looking to create a new network, simply create an object with the following attributes:

1. A list of nodes.
2. A list of edges, represented as a list of tuples containing the edges between all nodes.

If you find this algorithm useful in your research, please consider citing our paper. The citation format will be available soon.
